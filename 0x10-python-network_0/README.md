# Python Network Project

This project aims to provide an understanding of various concepts related to URLs, HTTP, and network communication using Python. It covers topics such as URL structure, HTTP methods, request and response headers, status codes, cookies, and making requests with cURL.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- Understand what a URL is and its components.
- Gain knowledge about the HTTP protocol and its key concepts.
- Learn how to read and interpret URLs.
- Understand the structure of HTTP URLs, including the scheme, domain name, sub-domain, and port number.
- Learn about query strings and how they are used in URLs.
- Understand the concepts of HTTP requests and responses, including headers and message bodies.
- Learn about common HTTP request methods and response status codes.
- Gain knowledge about HTTP cookies and their usage.
- Learn how to make requests using cURL.
- Understand the application-level process when typing a URL in a browser.

## Project Requirements

- All scripts and Python files should be exactly 3 lines long.
- All files must be executable and have the correct shebang (`#!/usr/bin/python3` for Python files and `#!/bin/bash` for Bash scripts).
- Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) to ensure code adherence to Python coding style guidelines.
- Include a README.md file at the root of the project folder.
