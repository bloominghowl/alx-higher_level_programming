# Python Network Project

This project demonstrates how to fetch internet resources, handle HTTP requests, and manipulate data from external services using Python. It utilizes the `urllib` and `requests` packages to interact with network resources and retrieve data.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to showcase the following concepts:

- Fetching internet resources with the Python package `urllib`
- Decoding `urllib` body response
- Using the Python package `requests` for making HTTP requests
- Making HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and other requests
- Fetching JSON resources
- Manipulating data from an external service

## Requirements

- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should adhere to the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.\*) code style guidelines
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- Use the `get` method to access dictionary values by key

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

2. Install the required packages by running the following command:
